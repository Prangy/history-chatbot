# history-chatbot

"Inspired by repositories like Llama 2, Chainlit, Faiss, and Sentence Transformers, I've built a sophisticated Medical Chatbot using open-source technologies. Leveraging Sentence Transformers for embeddings and Faiss CPU for vector storage, I integrated Llama 2, a large language model, using Chainlit library for conversational interface.

This project aims to democratize conversational AI in healthcare, offering an intelligent and efficient solution accessible to all, regardless of prior experience. Find my project on GitHub for a detailed exploration."
